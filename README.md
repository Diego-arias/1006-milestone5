A bibliography with at least five references, one of which will be the article you are replicating.
A 300 – 500 word overview of your replication paper. What analysis did they run? What did they conclude?
An Appendix which include a replication of at least one of the tables from your paper. (It can be a simple summary table.) Also, take a screen shot of the original table and include that image in your Appendix. We want to see how closely your results match the original paper’s.
